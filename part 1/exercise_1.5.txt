Image comparison using the command:
    docker image ls >> exercise_1.5.txt
NOTE: other images in Docker has been removed in this text file.

REPOSITORY                          TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service   ubuntu    4e3362e907d5   2 years ago     83MB
devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service   alpine    fd312adc88e0   2 years ago     15.7MB

We can see that the size of alpine image is much smaller than ubuntu image.

The command to make sure the secret message work the same:
    1. Start the container with alpine image:
        docker run -it devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:alpine
    2. Create a new process in the container (name of the container: interesting_vaughan):
        docker exec -it interesting_vaughan sh
    3. Check the log file:
        tail -f ./text.log
